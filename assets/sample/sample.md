# Professional README Generator

## Description
This project is a Professional README generator that was created using node.js. This project was designed to be used to make quick and efficient professional README's using only the command bar by entering a variety of questions. To create this project I used Node.js, along with the node module inquirer to be able to ask questions and recieve/utilize feedback. I struggled a little bit at first with getting to and accessing the data from the inquirer prompts, but once that was figured out it was pretty much smooth sailing.

## Installation
To install this project you must first clone the repo, then run 'npm install' to install the neccessary modules.

## Usage
To use and utilize this project you must first follow the instructions to install it, then you need to run 'node index' in the command bar while in the root directory of the cloned repo. Once you have initialized the program you just answer all the questions that you think pertain to your project and then you will be presented with a professional README file. A good example of use for this project would be to utilize it so that you dont have to type out all of the code and whatnot for the structure of the README, rather you just answer the questions and your done, it is quicker and more efficient.
